    <h3>History of the Wicked Witch of the West (1939 film)</h3>
    <div class="row"></div>
    <div class="col-md-2"></div>
    <div class="col-md-4">In the 1939 version of The Wizard of Oz, Margaret Hamilton plays the Wicked Witch of the West as a green-skinned witch dressed in a long black dress with a black pointed hat.
    She does not wear an eye-patch like in the novel. This representation of the Wicked Witch has become a standard for what witches resemble and an archetype of human wickedness.
    While the relationship is not mentioned in Baum's books, in the movie, the Witch is the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East.
    The movie makes her even more of a primary antagonist, and consequently she appears in the film much earlier (and more often), than in Baum's original novel.
    She demands the Munchkins reveal who killed her sister, not long after Dorothy's arrival in Oz. She is described by Glinda the Good Witch of the North,
    not the South as in the book, as "worse than the other one". She actively seeks revenge against Dorothy for killing her sister, even though it was "accidental".
    However, as soon as the Witch is reminded of the ruby slippers, all interest in her sister's death vanishes and all she cares about is obtaining her slippers,
    which will enable her to conquer Oz. She is more menacing than her literary counterpart, making Dorothy too afraid to ever lose her temper with the Witch.
    She makes sure that Dorothy knows her power when Dorothy meets the Scarecrow by throwing a ball of fire at them. Before Dorothy and her friends get to the city,
    the Witch casts a sleeping spell over a field of poppies through which the group must pass. Glinda remotely counteracts the spell with snowfall.
    The Wicked Witch then flies on her broom over the Emerald City, demanding that the citizens of the Emerald City surrender Dorothy to her,
    and the Wizard demands the destruction of the Witch, with her broom as proof, in exchange for granting the wishes of Dorothy and her companions.
    Unlike Baum's original depiction, the Wicked Witch sends the Winged Monkeys as the first wave of attack. The Golden Cap is not mentioned but,
    after the failure of her poppy spell, the Witch does hold and then angrily cast away a costume piece that could be considered the cap
    (It greatly resembles the Cap as depicted in W. W. Denslow's original illustrations for The Wonderful Wizard of Oz) and was mentioned as her "wishing cap" in the original shooting script.
    She is killed when Dorothy throws a bucket of water on her, in attempt to put out a fire the witch bestowed on the Scarecrow.
    In the novel, Dorothy simply throws it on her in a fit of anger. There is no prior mention of the Wicked Witch's vulnerability to water in the movie,
    save for a split-second before the water actually douses her when she screams "Don't throw that water!" (this line does not appear in the film's shooting script).
    After the Wicked Witch of the West is dead, her soldiers are glad to be free of her power, and quote "Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!"
    The character ranks No. 4 in the American Film Institute's list of the 50 Best Movie Villains of All Time, making her the highest ranking female villain,
    as well as placing 90th on Empire magazine's 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.
​
    Margaret Hamilton and Oscar the Grouch in 1976
    Hamilton's other role in this film is the Witch's Kansas sepia tone counterpart, Miss Almira Gulch, newly created for the film by screenwriter Noel Langley.
    She is a socialite who owns half the county. She arrives on her bicycle at the farm and says to Uncle Henry:
    "Mr. Gale! I'd like to speak with you and your wife right away about Dorothy!" Dorothy's dog, Toto, has bitten her leg,
    and she wants to take him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed. Dorothy calls her "a wicked old witch." Miss Gulch takes Toto away in her basket,
    but he escapes. In the tornado scene, Dorothy sees Miss Gulch on her bicycle transform into a Wicked Witch, flying on her broom.</div>

                        <p>The Wicked Witch of the West is a fictional character created by American author L. Frank Baum as the antagonist in his classic children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900).
                        In Baum's subsequent Oz novels, it is the Nome King who is the principal villain; the Wicked Witch of the West is rarely even referred to again after her death in the first book.</p>
                        <p>The witch's most popular depiction was in the classic 1939 film based on Baum's novel, where she was portrayed by Margaret Hamilton. Hamilton's characterization introduced green skin and this has been continued in later literary and dramatic representations, including Gregory Maguire's revisionist Oz novel Wicked:
                        The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (1995) and its musical stage adaptation Wicked (2003), the 2013 film Oz the Great and Powerful, and the television series Once Upon a Time and Emerald City.</p>

                        <p>Wicked is a Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman.
                        It is based on the Gregory Maguire novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L.
                        Frank Baum and the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Wizard of Oz (1939).</p>
                        <p>The musical is told from the perspective of the witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and continues after Dorothy Gale arrives in Oz from Kansas, and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel.
                        Wicked tells the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (whose name later changes to Glinda the Good Witch), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's public fall from grace.</p>
                        <p>Produced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with Marc Platt, Jon B. Platt and David Stone, with direction by Joe Mantello and choreography by Wayne Cilento, the original production of Wicked premiered on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's Curran Theatre in May/June of that same year.
                        Its original stars included Idina Menzel as Elphaba, Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda, and Joel Grey as the Wizard.
                        The original Broadway production won three Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards, while its original cast album received a Grammy Award.</p>
                        <p>Wicked celebrated its tenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2013.
                        On October 28, 2019, with its 6,681st performance, it surpassed Les Miserables to become Broadway's fifth-longest running show.
                        A typical performance takes approximately two hours and 30 minutes, plus a 15-minute intermission.</p>
                        <p>The success of the Broadway production has spawned several other productions worldwide, including various North American productions, a long-running Laurence Olivier Award–nominated West End production, and a series of international productions.
                        Since its 2003 debut, Wicked has broken box-office records around the world, currently holding weekly-gross-takings records in Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis, and London.
                        In the week ending January 2, 2011, the London, Broadway, and both North American touring productions simultaneously broke their respective records for the highest weekly gross.
                        In the final week of 2013, the Broadway production broke this record again, earning $3.2 million.</p>
                        <p>In March 2016, Wicked surpassed $1 billion in total Broadway revenue, joining both The Phantom of the Opera and The Lion King as the only Broadway shows to do so.
                        In July 2017, Wicked surpassed The Phantom of the Opera as Broadway's second-highest grossing musical, trailing only The Lion King.</p>
